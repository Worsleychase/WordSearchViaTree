# WordSearchViaTree
Word search/spell check algorithm with data structure for COSC 2030

This is a programming assignment I decided to do early during the spring semester of 2024. There is a competition for run-times, I am competitive. Please see the attached "prog2.pdf" for the problem. The code should be commented well enough to not warrant further discussion in the README. I am very proud of this assignment because my first version of my code was already 1.6 times faster than his. Using a tree data structure with custom nodes and classes, see diagram in myTree.h for clarification on how this works.
